"Moonshine glow, slurping, falls where will our lie."
"Rough mania slummers, while gleaming eclipse whole."
"Fall moonshine slurps, while growing surreal hollow."
"Moon's glow whispers, hurling alleys of summer elf."
"Laughing wolf slurps, meanwhile, moonrise swooner."
"We simmer, ghoulish, slurping fellow's lunar whole."
